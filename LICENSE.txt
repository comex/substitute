Some files in this repository contain their own licensing info in a header:
substrate.h, which is based on an older version of CydiaSubstrate, is under
LGPLv3, and substitute.h and the generated files are in the public domain.  (So
if you want to take advantage of the more lax permission below, you can't use
the Substrate compatibility layer; also, the Debian package includes the
obligatory copy of the (L)GPLv3.)
